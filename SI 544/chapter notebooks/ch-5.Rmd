## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
library(skimr)
library(gapminder)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
evals_ch5 <- evals %>%
  select(ID, score, bty_avg, age)

glimpse(evals_ch5)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
evals_ch5 %>%
  sample_n(size = 5)
```
```{r}
evals_ch5 %>%
  summarize(mean_bty_avg = mean(bty_avg), mean_score = mean(score),
            median_bty_avg = median(bty_avg), median_score = median(score))
```
```{r}
evals_ch5 %>% select(score, bty_avg) %>% skim()
```
```{r}
evals_ch5 %>% 
  get_correlation(formula = score ~ bty_avg)
```
```{r}
evals_ch5 %>% 
  summarize(correlation = cor(score, bty_avg))
```

```{r}
ggplot(evals_ch5, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Beauty Score", 
       y = "Teaching Score",
       title = "Scatterplot of relationship of teaching and beauty scores")
```
```{r}

(LC5.6) Using either the sorting functionality of RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or using the data wrangling tools you learned in Chapter 3, identify the five countries with the five smallest (most negative) residuals? What do these negative residuals say about their life expectancy relative to their continents’ life expectancy?
Afghanistan, Swaziland, Mozambique, Haiti, Zambia

(LC5.7) Repeat this process, but identify the five countries with the five largest (most positive) residuals. What do these positive residuals say about their life expectancy relative to their continents’ life expectancy?
Reunion, Libya, Tunisia, Mauritius, Algeria
